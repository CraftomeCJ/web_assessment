for GenerationSG web assessment: Colmar Academy Project

Question 1: What did I like about this project?
Answer: This project give me an opportunity to apply what I had learned the past 2 weeks on Front-End Development. 
It is a wonderful opportunity to apply all the concept learned, lose sleep about it, 
hair pulling moments when @media go wrong or layout turn out to be opposite of expectations. 
All is fun playing with different CSS concept, lots of google, and trial and error a lot more practise is required.

Question 2: What did I struggle with this project?
Answer: A good sprint, tired but enjoyable, even work through the night, manage to complete a rough compose MVP,
unfortunately the outcome is not what i expected. lot of bugs unsolved, unable to understand why first half of the project look so well cooked, 
but after implementing another concept it completely destroy the whole layout and with a lack of time to rescue it, 
while in zombie time, time passed like lightning... a blink... daylights... LOL ... clock time.. big struggle...

Question 3: What would make my experience with this assessment better?
Annswer: If this assessment is given a weekend to do it will be perfect, learning curve is always steep at the beginning stage 
with lack of experience and limitation of coding concepts, most importantly I will embrace every learning experiences, 
it will alter my neuroplasticity that adapt to similiar or new challenges or experiences in future.
